And here we&amp;rsquo;re looking at her kitchen that she did for the Unité d&amp;rsquo;habitation in Marseille. And that was kind of the most important post war housing development.
Tom Sachs: The Corbusier, you know they say he was a Nazi sympathizer, but he I think he just wanted to be on the side that was going to win.</description>

      <description>MC: But it&amp;rsquo;s an extremely dynamic tension. It&amp;rsquo;s old versus new skill versus concept, tradition versus innovation. And tonight Tom versus Tom.
MC: We are lucky to have two creative geniuses with us that represent both ends of our spectrum. In this corner. Tom Wolfe, one of America&amp;rsquo;s best known and best selling authors. He&amp;rsquo;s credited with creating the new journalism movement along with the likes of Hunter Thompson and Gay Talese.</description>

      <description>let&amp;rsquo;s go in the talking room I&amp;rsquo;m four four by the way thanks for being on the tugs for having for the viewers who don&amp;rsquo;t know I wanted to start by talking a little bit about your your early history about your first making experience and then where you came to understand that what you were making was art and what you wanted to make was this conversation so my early making history is I was forbidden to build things unlike you I my parents were afraid of tools or they didn&amp;rsquo;t understand them so I wasn&amp;rsquo;t allowed to use the tried to sneak the drill and my tool was a hacksaw that had because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t strong enough to use the big wood saw so everything I had one dull hacksaw blade in a frame or just a frame in a frame yeah you know and and so I was forbidden but then later when I was in college I a young woman was a couple years older than me taught me how to weld and then dumped me and broke my heart and left me with a welder she lit yeah and she said you know okay now and so with a broken heart I fueled my all of my heartache into making a couple of really terrible sculptures my parents garage still so wait what kind of welder I want to know it was like a arc welder the cot the machine like a good arc welder but it was not even a little Lincoln tombstone it was something from like the 50s it was gigantic and built in giant plug copper plugs you plugged in yeah with a clamp and you clamp it onto the work and then it arc welding right yeah this yes and it&amp;rsquo;s I think it&amp;rsquo;s a great way to start that&amp;rsquo;s how I first weld it yeah stick and a MIG I mean which is easy but it&amp;rsquo;s great when you know that well it&amp;rsquo;s I think the ultimate is gas gas oxy acetylene welding that&amp;rsquo;s the I&amp;rsquo;ve never done it that&amp;rsquo;s the proper like old school that&amp;rsquo;s you know that&amp;rsquo;s like programming yes you could I&amp;rsquo;m writing code you told me to get the TIG yeah I turned out that I actually had a TIG I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet out figure it but that&amp;rsquo;s the next thing I&amp;rsquo;m going to do over in my metalworking area is sit down in Italy well that&amp;rsquo;s it kind of makes everything else obsolete because you can kind of do all the other ones in one one of our guys in the shop where he learned welding his teacher told them that he could do this and the kids were all like so his teacher welded a soda can right well the two halves of soda came together with the TIG right with the end but that the if he could do that he learned on a healy arc really well that&amp;rsquo;s what TIG is that was like the old school word for it and the old guys in a world war two or after you know could weld like a cigarette oil I think the benchmark of but you know for me a lot of that um there&amp;rsquo;s this whole social component and the mythology of David Smith who like Bob Marley died before he had time to suck and his early who was also a welder and worked in an auto plant um you know they had this there was a machismo blue-collar machismo to to welding it&amp;rsquo;s the you know but it goes back to the Middle Ages where the you know the blacksmith was the only blue-collar guy in that in the round table right in the clay he was you know he was super vital you see he was so important that he was you know although he was a still blue-collar who was elevated to the next so this is well it&amp;rsquo;s controlling fire right but that idea of the blue-collar that gets the tape gets to the table right is this is a little bit of a tangent but I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on this talk that I don&amp;rsquo;t know where to give yet and micros kind of talking about it but bringing back a cultural value to welding and autumn we&amp;rsquo;re have a shortage in this country of welders and auto mechanics and hydraulics engineers and you know caterpillar has trouble filling its roster with real engineers and I personally think that going to a vocational school to learn one of those skills is totally here in our culture where it&amp;rsquo;s all follow your dreams everyone thinks that&amp;rsquo;s kind of beneath them right well we have the rule in the studio you&amp;rsquo;re not allowed to go to graduate school unless you&amp;rsquo;re going to get a degree in law or medicine or vocational school basically something where you need a license everything else you should just learn by doing and this is sort of right it&amp;rsquo;s an offshoot of Verner Hertzog&amp;rsquo;s thing where you should you know to be a filmmaker you should learn martial arts document forging and foreign languages things that will help you write write write and so you know we&amp;rsquo;re up against things like business school or at school those are writing school those are forbidden you just go and you get a job as a journalist so what was the first what was their first object that is like the primordial precursor to what later got made is there some talismanic thing that you made early on yeah as a child my dad really wanted this Olymp is a Nikon fm2 which was like the smaller version of the Nikon F series I and for whatever reason like you couldn&amp;rsquo;t afford it so he bought the Olympus om one which was one of those yeah and that&amp;rsquo;s it later that later became my camera I was my first camp yeah the OM one and right yeah it&amp;rsquo;s really great it&amp;rsquo;s a little smaller and I think probably equivalent quality but you know Nikon&amp;rsquo;s a little more status than yeah and if I went back to film I would use you know I&amp;rsquo;m one cuz that&amp;rsquo;s like you know what I would default that&amp;rsquo;s the one that I don&amp;rsquo;t know and so in fifth grade or whatever I made a Nikon fm2 out of clay no with little film that you could slit in the back and I think it was important because it was an expression of the ritual of consumption Ryan our family like that my dad wanted this camera he really really wanted we talked about enough that I went had made one in school and that was a precursor for for a lot of the things that I&amp;rsquo;ve made are things like you that I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted for one reason or another that&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s interesting the idea of like making the the the copy of the thing but making it also as a gesture as a gift for somebody that that&amp;rsquo;s the impetus in addition I mean because I think of your work is being very much having this duality between I love this brand I love this consumption and I hate the part of me that loves this consumption all at the same time yeah it&amp;rsquo;s embarrassing right to be so consumerist but we&amp;rsquo;re all that way and we all want whatever add a vanishing point charger or an iPhone or whatever the thing that we don&amp;rsquo;t have and there&amp;rsquo;s a anthropological term for this and it&amp;rsquo;s called in some way cargo cult ISM where you you know you build a model of the airplane that drops food or you build a model of the refrigerator that the anthropologists have or you build a model we you know when you say hey how come those planes don&amp;rsquo;t land and and the anthropologist says well it&amp;rsquo;s because you you need a runway and so like the local guys they build a runway and more anthropologists land on the runway so they can see the runway right and they actually create it but did it and it&amp;rsquo;s far out to think about you making it at how old were you when you made it as a gift when you made the camera you know five or six eight at the oldest so that&amp;rsquo;s like a it&amp;rsquo;s a strangely generous thing for a child to do it seems to me but it&amp;rsquo;s sort of like so when when I think about it it makes total sense because like I look at your ermes McDonald&amp;rsquo;s meal and I feels both it feels both castigating and loving all at the same time and I&amp;rsquo;d like I see the direct jump to the loving thing of the kid giving his dad the thing he wanted well I think the thing that&amp;rsquo;s important to me is the transformative power of the object so you make as a model because you want something and then it maybe become something totally different I mean I make a McDonald&amp;rsquo;s meal out of a Tiffany package or in the first thing they made a fashion packaging was a Glock because I really wanted a Glock has cops in New York were just getting rid of their revolvers and they were getting automatics and they were plastic and they were cool and they were cheap and high-quality and so I really wanted one but getting a gun in Manhattan such a pain in the ass and so the licensing is impossible it&amp;rsquo;s not just it was just expensive it&amp;rsquo;s like five hundred bucks a year or something it&amp;rsquo;s cost prohibitive right and so I thought well if I make this project about it I can kind of justify it and then so I got to like have a gun which is just a stupid irresponsible thing for me to have in a place like that yeah and it was a way of me you know coming to terms with this does this desire and like getting it out of my system but also being in touch with this other kind of decadent glamorous embarrassing advertising side that was paying for my life that was you know I was working in a department store as a window designer so I was it was a way of integrating all these things and having the things that I made be connected with my life because the were interested in all these things but the these objects that that you make and that I made but the thing that we&amp;rsquo;re really interested in is the story around it like it&amp;rsquo;s not just a survival kit it&amp;rsquo;s the can I mention oh yeah by oh me it&amp;rsquo;s a survival kit from Strangelove that we are obsessing over literally obsessing over every detail and imagining things that were potentially there and going to the nth degree but I thought I was going to dance agree and then I sent you my file on it of like the 18 objects that I determined 15 mentioned by Kong and then five that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t and then you wrote back and said I think the 45 caliber gun should be real and that totally redefined the way I was thinking about the accuracy of the kit well and that made the obsession go one level well yeah and I stand by that that comment because I think if you use a real gun and a thing is a little bit realer I mean that&amp;rsquo;s a it&amp;rsquo;s you&amp;rsquo;re gonna be a lot more expensive than a plastic gun yeah you know if you go all the way you&amp;rsquo;re using a real antique revolver which has all kinds of legal complications yeah I don&amp;rsquo;t want to mess with but in terms of authenticity just to consider you could go there yeah or you demilitarize them and then it&amp;rsquo;s like costs a little bit more but it&amp;rsquo;s or buy them from the film industry I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about the you know the but the point is it it has you know a real you know might have been used to kill someone so that it has this this unknown value or experience like a used book versus a new book you know it has got like its hair and food stains on it you were obsessed with guns long before you fired one right yeah yeah yeah it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s a fascinating thing I mean because I made tons of sculptures of guns I make my first Blade Runner gun when I was 18 first time I fired one I think I was about 25 and I remember loading it in that my friend and I went to a gun range and we ranked it well Ruger nine and we I knew how to load it because I was obsessed with guns but having a loaded thing in my hand was absolutely terrifying and I still find it awful yeah at the same time as totally compelling it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s an unsettling thing that mean it on one side there&amp;rsquo;s the engineering and the historical thing that&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting object but that the sort of power of them is is intriguing and frightening but you know a lot of it went back to that it was forbidden much like building was forbidden right so I think my initial inspiration was that I was an adult and I could do what I want and but you know like uh the you know I was also like my parents were really concerned that I was gay so they kind of were tried to like shoo me away from Barbies and stuff and I was really into Barbie because she had those fantastic tits um so would always steal my sisters Barbie and you know thumbing her cleavage no not the one that because there was one whose cleavage grew oh now I see those more things eBay wait no no I I remember correctly this might be an urban legend it was it was a Barbie it was like a Barbie&amp;rsquo;s teen sister oh and and if you pulled her arm back her breasts grew and girls were actually trying this at slumber parties thinking that the physical mechanism for making your breasts bigger well that&amp;rsquo;s some kind of that might be everything I believe it but I remember making one out of plywood in the basement secretly a Barbie yeah because I on my own I remember feeling being kind of the Barbie&amp;rsquo;s leg right so up till then I the the most Barbies leg was like kind of sensual because the event in the mecca came inside yeah I took one apart recently to see it&amp;rsquo;s really just it&amp;rsquo;s plastic click click click but but it and you know all I&amp;rsquo;d had up to that point was the Six Million Dollar Man where you could roll the skin up on his arm and pull out the computer chip but that was nothing compared to how real Barbies right actually felt like it was shapely and soft it was weird yeah but I was also frustrated Barbie because compared to GI Joe she was really not fun to play right he just do stuff yeah she her arms are like yeah okay so was there like you you you went to Bennington yeah did you do any art there that&amp;rsquo;s where that story about the welder happened focus in college so yeah and that&amp;rsquo;s that&amp;rsquo;s sort of all I did I just did the minimum classes so that I could use the great welding studio they had there and that&amp;rsquo;s I kind of got lucky that I was so sort of a great success immediately in that I had a lot of attention for doing it I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it was I don&amp;rsquo;t it wasn&amp;rsquo;t really a lot of attention till much later but I was good at it and I felt right and I was learning about the world through sculpture so I knew I was on the right track I mean it wasn&amp;rsquo;t it was 10 or 15 years later before I ever sold anything but it was I had this the sense of success that I have now then because I was able to because I was like a real loser before then I didn&amp;rsquo;t like it was a seat I was a bunch of my friends were valedictorians that I&amp;rsquo;m friends with now and I was the second to last and that was literally the bare minimum yeah and I was that was my whole experience until I was in college and then I would anything related to our like philosophy and you know semiotic sand stuff like that I started to excel at because I could relate it architecture history in theory I could relate to the things that I was interested in sculpture so I finally learned how to read in college I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how properly read properly Parsa Texas yeah and it&amp;rsquo;s still hard if I&amp;rsquo;m not interested in the subject together a little learning-disabled the guys who I feel like seem to me clearly influenced your work now like Duchamp and Cornell did you gravitate to those guys really early oh yeah I mean I think in my first semester in college I discovered those guys and Duchamp floors me and even now it seems so insanely radical yeah his mind quite put him anywhere specific I think in a way is the ultimate and I think a lot of it has to do with the austerity or restraint because found object arts really in a way it&amp;rsquo;s easy and I think a lot of the things that I did in the beginning were you know there&amp;rsquo;s always some is there all these tropes in art school the kid who you know the angry girl who makes a sculpture about her dad or with menstrual blood or like there was the kid who makes out of baby dolls right yeah I was out for a little while Ron English yeah yeah yeah I don&amp;rsquo;t run oh you do wrong yes great um and you know Marcel Duchamp was like the in the eighties thrift shops were better than they are now and you can actually it was worth going to them now it&amp;rsquo;s really not I mean if you unless you know they&amp;rsquo;re gonna have the right piece of crap like because we&amp;rsquo;re we they&amp;rsquo;re selling things now that were built in the 80s versus we were buying things are built in the 50s I try and talk about it was like to browse on Canal Street in 1985 oh yeah you know this is nothing like that yeah the bins of yeah um so you now have like you have ten assistants right now about I&amp;rsquo;m trying to team I&amp;rsquo;m trying to cut back but yeah I&amp;rsquo;m about ten and you those guys work full-time with you for you on your projects on the shop yeah it&amp;rsquo;s a team and with some of the you know this one woman who&amp;rsquo;s been with me for 10 years and Oksana we&amp;rsquo;ve been building stuff together and it&amp;rsquo;s a team where you know I&amp;rsquo;m the sort of the captain but there are people all over the different parts of the studio of different talents that I don&amp;rsquo;t possess mainly patience that&amp;rsquo;s probably the biggest one the patience for for doing the same thing over and over and which is important because sculpture is just a reorganization or everything&amp;rsquo;s just a reorganization of materials and to you know to transform a piece of plywood into a sculpture it takes many many hours of ritual a brief or extended liminal stage and then finally the object is transformed when it leaves and it&amp;rsquo;s all that ritual like a martial art or something that gives the work its its power because I always respected Marcel Duchamp and I always wanted to be that kind of artist and I even tried to put whatever on a pedestal and talk about it and did that for a while but it was really not very gratifying because it was the building that in all the time that I spent with my hands that gave me a sense of satisfaction self-worth though so it was actually the work that made it meaningful yeah um so I think that&amp;rsquo;s one of the reasons I gravitated away from ready-made stuff yeah the closest I feel to him is him spending the whole summer putting back together the broken glass from the bride yeah you know just carefully piece by piece that I can us that I can identify with but he&amp;rsquo;s not as nearly as attached to the construction right but yet I think he helped Cornell with carpentry now I don&amp;rsquo;t really know the whole story but it&amp;rsquo;s in that book I can look it up I think there&amp;rsquo;s some stuff word you know they that&amp;rsquo;s we conduct make stuff between chess games yeah exactly and yeah I mean of the whole idea of being a chess teachers very um it&amp;rsquo;s very rich I mean that&amp;rsquo;s smart and French yeah sure I tried to play I I can play chess I&amp;rsquo;m not very good but I specifically learned and like challenged everyone I knew for a few years back in my 20s because of Duchamp I have like well yeah like everything else I have a collection I&amp;rsquo;m about 15 or 20 chess sets and storage I never you made one no I bought years ago I bought a beautiful travel chess board which folds up and actually holds the game in its state oh cool so the board sits there and these two leaves fold open and then you can fold the leaves down and fold it up and it&amp;rsquo;s the size of a large hardback book but it holds the game where you left it which is awesome really and I bought it at a garage sale for like eight bucks the whites which I had are ivory and they&amp;rsquo;re beautiful but it didn&amp;rsquo;t have the black pieces so I Rema scheen them out of aluminum that counts as making yeah you did but only made half that counts so did you even start out with ten assistants you start out with one or two started out with well I started out as a contractor and I hired my friends to help me do renovations or window display or welding jobs and if there were extra materials that I could steal from the job or extra hours in the day that I could steal from the job I would I would get one of the people that I was hiring to help me make one of my sculptures or some element to one of my sculptures and build a canvas or panel so then delegation has always been a natural part of the process and understanding that you know there&amp;rsquo;s a there&amp;rsquo;s a whole flow of keeping jobs going and and learning and teaching and I always you know I spent the first five years in New York just doing illegal elevator and fire escape repairs for my landlord like non-union like just hanging it I had like wrenches on little shoelaces so I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t drop them like five story were like climbing scaling inside of an elevator to fix it yeah well just like you know I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t I didn&amp;rsquo;t go up and down I&amp;rsquo;d usually work in like the bulkhead or in the elevator itself or on top but I never like climbed like that video game where you climb inside the elevator but I definitely did things I shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have I mean he must have been so cheap Ted we&amp;rsquo;re still friends and um and I remember them as I sort of gradually tried to get out of that it was harks I felt like I was letting him down because I wasn&amp;rsquo;t doing the elevator to get he&amp;rsquo;s work on the oh yeah yeah but also the the actual you know running the beads and the actual the technical welding and all the stuff was was craft and there was a sense of you know connection with it and learning and fulfillment that I&amp;rsquo;ve always kept with the work so when I work with the team I&amp;rsquo;m always like engineering and designing or figuring out the design of the thing and then teaching the method so that it gets so that it&amp;rsquo;s executed properly but also so that the experience of doing it has the transformative process doing repetitive work over and over again help can help transform the most a DD people I mean have this huge collection of adderall which I take for fun it&amp;rsquo;s been given to me by young people who don&amp;rsquo;t need it anymore because they learned through wood burning repetitively how they can find right focus right one of my kids is ADHD and they&amp;rsquo;ve said there he asked about the medication and it&amp;rsquo;s one of his doctors said well you know there are a lot of there are a lot of pilots airline pilots who don&amp;rsquo;t take their medication anymore because they don&amp;rsquo;t need to because the job is is precise enough and requires the right amount of their attention that they want to give to it that they don&amp;rsquo;t need that medication and that&amp;rsquo;s a that&amp;rsquo;s a huge transformation because it&amp;rsquo;s a very toxic thing which should only be done recreationally that&amp;rsquo;s that I hadn&amp;rsquo;t thought of the transformation I mean I think of the transformation is happening to me when I&amp;rsquo;m doing something repetitive because the practice is very meditative but I haven&amp;rsquo;t thought about giving somebody else that transformation as part of giving them a task yeah I would like to think of the studios a teaching hospital right because we all learn from the experience and it&amp;rsquo;s a it&amp;rsquo;s a process of individual transformation and the people I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with dozens of people over the years and I feel like if I added it up it might even be a hundred or something I maybe maybe not quite it a lot and it&amp;rsquo;s like your own Atelier some of the people either graduate yeah the rare person is expelled that&amp;rsquo;s like stealing you got expelled something like that or I think if you we rule about fire because ever Tufte says that um 20% of all artists biographies have a title called the fire chapter the chapter the describe they&amp;rsquo;re called fire one stage to the myth and so you get fired if you light the place on fire because yeah and into that but most people drop out it&amp;rsquo;s attrition they drop out for various reasons yeah they don&amp;rsquo;t you know they don&amp;rsquo;t make the transformation where else some people are just are there for a very long time but I think the ideal is is that the transformation occurs and and a few people have graduated and go on to do their own thing I have so 10 bullets is your website with a bunch of www ten bullets comm we&amp;rsquo;re going to link the hell WWE and let&amp;rsquo;s calm so those are your shop your shop rules your shop ethos they that developed over time John Ferguson when he graduated wrote ten bullets as his graduation gift to me really yeah and he left to start his own studio and it was it was these were the things that he believed you know he was quoting me in some of it but he organized it into ten things that he would want his successor to know and I considered one you know the greatest gift and so van nice tat and I made the movie ten bullets based on on the little booklet that John made knowing he was great studio assistant and friend and still lives on the block and we see each other so does it those rules they seem like a very important they seem like a really important tool that I mean rules are always a restriction on behavior and they have you know every artist chooses a set of arbitrary restrictions on their work for some type of problem solving they want to achieve and how did how does that how did that process come about of deciding to restrict yourself to certain colors and certain processes and actually I mean I read the story about you working in Geary&amp;rsquo;s furniture studio and being told don&amp;rsquo;t show the endgrain so you&amp;rsquo;re like and I&amp;rsquo;m going to show the endgrain right but when I work for Frank Gehry there was a master carpenter who I was his assistant that was my job and he was a fine woodworking guy I could professor super high level guy and he said don&amp;rsquo;t show the endgrain clients don&amp;rsquo;t like to see it and I you know of course was like you yeah I&amp;rsquo;m gonna make it I made a 4x8 sheet of plywood where I like sliced in a million pieces and turned them all so it was a whole and grain piece of plywood and I think that was as I was leaving that place that was my way of transport making my transformation get out of there but I think it&amp;rsquo;s something that stuck with me and Frank Gehry&amp;rsquo;s furniture the all the plywood stuff that&amp;rsquo;s in his office is all three quarter-inch ac4 plywood that you always see the end grain and very often it&amp;rsquo;s you know something inch and a half like this you&amp;rsquo;ll see two layers of it and that&amp;rsquo;s especially Frank&amp;rsquo;s early work has a lot of transparency of the construction it&amp;rsquo;s almost very Bauhaus and its philosophy even though it&amp;rsquo;s way more home depot than waking it actually on its sleeve yeah and that&amp;rsquo;s usually that&amp;rsquo;s like a really central thing well I just think in this timewe if you look at your cell phone or computer or camera or whatever everything is so perfect and I could never make anything as perfect is that or maybe I could john henry style make one kill me but Apple can never make something that shows the human touch the air or the fingerprints you know the stains and glue drips and all that stuff that shows that that a human being was here when you look at an iPhone it says a robot was here right or as Roland Bart says the object appears as if it was miraculously hatched yeah what&amp;rsquo;s in it&amp;rsquo;s a black box in their term of art is the black box because you can&amp;rsquo;t see inside right and can&amp;rsquo;t get inside we&amp;rsquo;re not even allowed inside um I wasn&amp;rsquo;t totally blown away by the color film on ten bullets specifically because you listed the exact serial numbers and names of each of the colors well color in a way is an improved version of ten bullets B this is a movie that&amp;rsquo;s 20 minutes long and it&amp;rsquo;s about the eight or ten colors that we use the studio standard colors yeah like we only use one or two blacks there&amp;rsquo;s only one white there&amp;rsquo;s only one red and and it goes on through through each color and we do and we name them because it&amp;rsquo;s hard and I and it&amp;rsquo;s that I have a big studio and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of delegation and oh and things go wrong but there&amp;rsquo;s I mean the mold I just didn&amp;rsquo;t want to ever have to explain myself ever again and right but there&amp;rsquo;s this other thing which is that artists love not to talk about how they&amp;rsquo;re doing what they&amp;rsquo;re doing well it&amp;rsquo;s a gouache technique but I&amp;rsquo;d rather not describe it exactly because they think somehow the technique is what&amp;rsquo;s defining them rather than what they&amp;rsquo;re doing with the tech right so to me it&amp;rsquo;s really a gala terian for you to actually post the actual cut it made me want to go and buy each of those colors just a place you should they&amp;rsquo;re good colors I&amp;rsquo;ve never final II sifted I respect and agree without philosophy because I think it creates more mystique and if I had more time or assets I would keep it a secret really I would have someone making sure repeating and make it being like a color supervisor I just can&amp;rsquo;t afford it so that&amp;rsquo;s why I just wanted to be transparent so that it says everyone knows and if something gets up you know what how to fix it and see I can move on and get the idea I think you&amp;rsquo;re getting the mystique out of thee you&amp;rsquo;re showing all the techniques and grain and the pen that pen on the foam core and the tape and visible hot glue and stuff and yet there&amp;rsquo;s still this an unbelievable object that came out of all of it right you&amp;rsquo;re like the magician who&amp;rsquo;s showing the trick of how he did the trick but that&amp;rsquo;s another trick in the right cell right well we love our friend Ricky J yeah and who&amp;rsquo;s about transparency at total deception the most deceptive possible a deception within a deception so when the you sent me the book on and I don&amp;rsquo;t know if I&amp;rsquo;m correct about this but your Wikipedia page describes that the nutsy exhibition was a big turning point in your career is that yeah is that right there&amp;rsquo;s no I think that was a pretty that was about 10 years ago and the liqueur bursae I&amp;rsquo;ve only read it up never how does that pronounce liqueur best local boozy a looker boozy a yeah liqueur boozy a building yeah they unit a to habitacion it totally that I texted you and I was like I&amp;rsquo;m overwhelmed by this book that&amp;rsquo;s the piece that killed yeah that&amp;rsquo;s a that&amp;rsquo;s a great I mean that building this is a the building is liquor booze yeas who&amp;rsquo;s the greatest architect of the 20th century his answer to solving the post-war housing crisis in Europe was to build this high-quality low-cost housing for working people for the new middle class or the working class and in the process he built the prototype for the projects right by accident well I mean there were some nineteenth-century versions of them and stuff but I think he in some circles is blamed for this and is very misunderstood because the unit a to habitacion was beautiful each apartment has two stories of beautiful light going through in circulation and delivery slots in the hallway for meat and milk and garbage going out so we don&amp;rsquo;t have to leave your apartments very modern and and it was a disaster because developers came and chopped these apartments in half and two four ones and and you know finally it&amp;rsquo;s coming back and and they were supposed to be 1500 of them there were there three and the one in Berlin doesn&amp;rsquo;t even have the Pilate legs that it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s just on the ground so it&amp;rsquo;s highly compromised but in spirit its its it it&amp;rsquo;s a great building and I was in Nazi as the comparison was between liqueur booze EA and Ray Kroc the inventor of McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and I always felt that liqueur boozy and all of his genius represents the failure of modernism and McDonald&amp;rsquo;s and all of its disgusting horror represents its success and so that is the essential comparison that I was trying to and I also love and hate both of these guys because it&amp;rsquo;s you know who doesn&amp;rsquo;t love McDonald&amp;rsquo;s really no it&amp;rsquo;s totally true the fries are perfect yeah I love in an upper gur and it&amp;rsquo;s the only fast-food I think I&amp;rsquo;ve had in 10 years now but their fries are okay and you can&amp;rsquo;t no matter what you can&amp;rsquo;t analyze them you can&amp;rsquo;t make them extra crispy they just are not so I&amp;rsquo;ve tried every technique with the fries and none of them make them better all right well if you read um behind the arches yeah which is the McDonald&amp;rsquo;s book there&amp;rsquo;s a 40 page explanation of the french fries it&amp;rsquo;s worth just reading that really yeah there&amp;rsquo;s there&amp;rsquo;s this theme in your work that I feel like I gravitate towards but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to get I don&amp;rsquo;t know if it&amp;rsquo;s been talked about enough because and then find a lot about it is an idea about American manliness about being a man and knowing how to make things and there&amp;rsquo;s a way in which you&amp;rsquo;re both the ring leader who makes these amazing objects but there is also a because they&amp;rsquo;re not perfect because their lack of perfection is on parade there&amp;rsquo;s a there&amp;rsquo;s a way in a sort of an admission of the flaw well I think a lot of that comes from my childhood where I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a builder and I grew up in a community where the women kind of ran things the men were commuting to Manhattan and the women were overseeing the contractors sleeping with them feeling with that date you know right they my mom was one who fix stuff in fact to stay my sister who&amp;rsquo;s married with three kids does all the repairs around the house and really her husband who brings the money and from his job yet doesn&amp;rsquo;t touch any of that stuff and in fact Martha Stewart was in my community my mother and her were close before Martha made the leap to hyperspace yeah um and you know that was all she was a handy woman she&amp;rsquo;d go to the train station with her eggs from the insell to the wives she would sell the eggs that she grew from the chickens in her yard to the wives who were dropping their husbands off so that they could have a car for the day because we had one car loved him I said one car then that wasn&amp;rsquo;t a sign of poverty it was just just one car was yet enough I mean that was kind of my introduction to it and there was this kind of a descaling it wasn&amp;rsquo;t I never really had a pretty reinstall with us probably the only thing that I would say I could if I could teach a college level course in anything craft it would be bent plywood from the time I spent in Frank&amp;rsquo;s okay ah yeah just because I that&amp;rsquo;s all I did for a year I again it goes really back to the value it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s an obsolete craft the craft is obsolete now because you just haven&amp;rsquo;t made in china&amp;rsquo; if you&amp;rsquo;re serious about building and I still believe in America and I still believe in making things and being able to fix things there&amp;rsquo;s not just a satisfaction about it but there&amp;rsquo;s also respect for the things in your life the other lives like I have terrible shame that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like I was really good on OS 9 but when ten happened I still don&amp;rsquo;t really understand it so I got really busy with the other stuff and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really like it&amp;rsquo;s still confusing to me and I try and use the old OS 9 looking window things we have files but none of the 10 people in the studio will indulge me so everything&amp;rsquo;s set up the other way and I just don&amp;rsquo;t know where anything is but thanks to spotlight I don&amp;rsquo;t need to write and thanks to all the great searches and Google I don&amp;rsquo;t need to keep all my images because other people are keeping them better and constantly improving and I think back a lot to Stanley Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s filing system have you checked out his like analog computers of data the the file cabinet with a : yeah but no that&amp;rsquo;s awesome - that&amp;rsquo;s incredible but I&amp;rsquo;m thinking there was some like probably IBM brand filing system that was a series of notebooks that went around writing the film and so each the pages all over I laughed a little bit to do a timeline but look at any day in the timeline yeah like that yeah another all analog and handwritten and yeah typed and I guess the and I know this is super tangential but I think I think it&amp;rsquo;s where maybe we connect a little bit as there&amp;rsquo;s a there&amp;rsquo;s value to being able to when - it&amp;rsquo;s almost like taking responsibility for your life because a lot of the technology that we have infantilizes us and removes our experience from whatever it is we&amp;rsquo;re doing we don&amp;rsquo;t remember any phone numbers anymore or how to get anywhere right my wife still gets pissed off that we go to LA and she says don&amp;rsquo;t you realize it&amp;rsquo;s just over the hill and I&amp;rsquo;m like I&amp;rsquo;m not thinking of LA in terms of Hills and north and south I think of it in terms of where my phone tells me where to go I know and it&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s hard because our now because of that you know the singularity I guess yeah we&amp;rsquo;re so our brains are so much weaker in that we need this phone but they&amp;rsquo;re so much more powerful because we have all that data and our brains are connected with our device but I still mean I think what you&amp;rsquo;re talking about with Kubrick&amp;rsquo;s analog system I still I mean the reason I sit and obsess about major Kong survival pack is because I find the practice of taking that inventory taking a discrete inventory of something like all of your measurements of the of the unit a and putting it in my head like I showed you upstairs my model of this house yes that&amp;rsquo;s how I know I know this house I found air ducts in the house just by measuring the rooms and building it and finding blank spaces in my model well yeah just started over on behind the wall there there are corners that I know that I now know there are these like secret hidden boxes and corners in this house that were not built in because they didn&amp;rsquo;t need to be or they brewed an air duct or an electrical line and that I find that process of inventory really satisfying when you draw something you see it so much yeah better than when you take a photograph of it yeah and there&amp;rsquo;s that great book by Lawrence Wechsler seeing is forgetting the name of the thing that one sees so when you really see something it&amp;rsquo;s about the work of Robert Irwin and when you really see something you&amp;rsquo;re seeing the form and the way light hits it and it becoming much more intimate with it and I think with major kong&amp;rsquo;s pack or The Maltese Falcon we&amp;rsquo;re talking about building it versus scanning it having it fabbed there&amp;rsquo;s a there&amp;rsquo;s greater sense of satisfaction you really understand the object when I left college I really was into the work of Viet Mondrian you know a painter and I really wanted one of them and I thought to myself I&amp;rsquo;m gonna get one and then I thought okay well what does that mean and that&amp;rsquo;s it okay if I really want one I&amp;rsquo;m gonna have to go downtown to Wall Street and go organize a lot of funding and then we have to put some time in down there to get the money to buy one and that&amp;rsquo;s a bit effect that&amp;rsquo;s a thing that you can do if you really want money just if you want Pretty Polly pluck her from the tree just go just go get it and that is where they make it is it&amp;rsquo;s that line from Citizen Kane where mr.</description>
