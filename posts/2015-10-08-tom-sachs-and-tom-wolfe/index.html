  <p class="card-description">A conversation between Tom Wolfe and Tom Sachs.</p>
  <p class="card-spacer">*</p>
  <p class="card-content"><p>MC: But it&rsquo;s an extremely dynamic tension. It&rsquo;s old versus new skill versus concept, tradition versus innovation. And tonight Tom versus Tom.</p>
<p>MC: We are lucky to have two creative geniuses with us that represent both ends of our spectrum. In this corner. Tom Wolfe, one of America&rsquo;s best known and best selling authors. He&rsquo;s credited with creating the new journalism movement along with the likes of Hunter Thompson and Gay Talese. He is also an artist.</p>
<p>MC: An an illustrator who is designed the covers of several of his own books like he has expressed his strong ideas about art and design through several books and essays, including the painted word an from our house to Bauhaus. In those books he&rsquo;s made the case that theory has become too important in art.</p>
<p>MC: And that the art world is too controlled by a small elitist network of critics, dealers, and collectors. By the way he&rsquo;s rumored to have a new book coming out in 2016. I was trying to meet with him for a couple of weeks over the summer and he kept delaying me because he was on deadline so.</p>
<p>MC: I think the deadlines finished by now.</p>
<p>MC: Or is it still?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Got it, got some scrub me up to do.</p>
<p>MC: So OK, OK, but anyway. So we finally did. We finally did get together and had a great afternoon in this corner. Tom Sachs. Tom is an artist, primarily a sculpture.</p>
<p>MC: Best known for his elaborate recreations of cultural icons and luxury brands through duct tape, phone books, foamcore and police barricades like Tom Wolfe Sachs idolizes astronauts, and that thing has continued through his space program, NASA and.</p>
<p>MC: Mars projects. He&rsquo;s also written many things and produced many writings and and seems on his work usually also illustrated by him. He is interested in the traditional and the handmade and utilizes them in his work, and though the work may be beautiful, the underlying theme is always.</p>
<p>MC: Conceptual, so whether it&rsquo;s Tom versus Tom or Tom and Tom or Tom loves Tom, we&rsquo;ll see how the thing goes tonight. I did want to also say thank you to Magnum real estate for hosting this event. We wanted you all to come here to see what our new student housing looks like.</p>
<p>MC: This, by the way, is.</p>
<p>MC: A double it&rsquo;s not a single.</p>
<p>MC: So just so you know.</p>
<p>MC: And the school itself is just around the corner on Franklin Street between West Broadway and church. And for anybody who has not been there, please come and visit us. We have over 100 Studios with a constantly changing.</p>
<p>MC: Array of very exciting, wonderful, an mostly figurative but not totally mostly figurative work, and we hope to see you next week. It takes a minute on October 18th.</p>
<p>MC: Oh my God.</p>
<p>MC: Dog on the 18th. And by the way, it&rsquo;s at Sotheby&rsquo;s not at the school, so don&rsquo;t show up at the school. Tom Wolf will have a piece in it, and I, uh, I hope by the end of the night, time&rsquo;s actually agreed to have a piece in it as well. This all is just an elaborate.</p>
<p>MC: Setup to get it to come in something so.</p>
<p>MC: But for tickets see the beautiful Allison Hillier over there or go to our website and wear white in honor of Tom Wolfe, who is one of the honorees along with the art critic Jerry Saltz, so without further ado, I give you Tom and Tom.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Well, I&rsquo;ll take a shot at.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: I did check 2 new.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Art forms today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: When I called, no hands are.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And the other is 10 year apart, as in T for Tom EE for easy and for Nathan.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: You are in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Probably the best examples of.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: No hands are Jeff Koons and Richard Serra.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: I was just looking at some pictures today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Jeff Koons and his woman, who was briefly married who called the Cuccinello, who gained fame through a scandal in Italy, was still famous when she came here.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And they had some pictures taken polaroids. I believe of themselves in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: I just about every position that nude bodies convenient.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And so you can imagine.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Um, I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: These were sent off to some elves.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: In the Midwest and we turned into 3 dimensional. The photographs he didn&rsquo;t touch the intensity photographs they were sent off to some else in the Midwest I think was Cleveland and they converted him into 3 dimensional glass sculptures.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Portugal.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: So extraordinary something.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And there&rsquo;s no, I mean they.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: I don&rsquo;t know how many.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Copies of each one there is, but there&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: That is not necessary limit.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: He&rsquo;s also done 45 for high rabbits.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Other people did them made of dirt. Yeah, other people handling girls getting heated up this thing.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: These are a number of other.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Works.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Along that line.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Can your heart?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Is something different?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: A lot of it is conceptual art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And the idea is to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Well, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: This is one I saw near Lakeland FL.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: The artist invited as many people as he could to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Media matters what was actually a like a small Lake.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Coming and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: He had with him 8.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: I&rsquo;m really heavy chain. I barely heard that I&rsquo;ve ever seen aside from something on a ship.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Away delaughter either end of the chain he had a large polyurethane bag full of vegetables.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: So he laid the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Chain on top of the water.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Um, of course I could be related to the bottom, but use mostly come back. I think it was 2 two months or something. I think I went. I was curious. I heard back.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And now the chain was lying on with a stretch across the top of the water. The vegetables had rotted.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Alright, in the bag creating a gas.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: That was enough to to lift it up. Now. I mean, I was astounded, but there&rsquo;s no way you could sell that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: That&rsquo;s where tenure art comes in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Also, the tenure artists are conceptual, and if you can do enough things like that enough works like that and get some publicity.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: You have a pretty good shot at getting a job teaching on the faculty, and after six years it used to be 10 years after six years. Now you get tenure.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And you&rsquo;re not going to live this high, but you&rsquo;re not going to have to live hard.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: You will be paid until your retirement age and then you get a pension.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: No more starving artist today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: So.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Those are I.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: I have changed.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: A lot since I wrote the painted.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: Work Oh my gosh, when did that come out?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: About 19, about 1980. I guess seven 1976.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: And it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: It&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: No, I&rsquo;m not done. That would be great.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I love those artists and this year we lost Chris Burton, who is the kind of artists who might have done a piece like the chain and the and the gas and the routing vegetables and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>How I fit in with that? But I I would say that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Because I work with people and I do, I have.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Valves in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I also have a team of 10 people that I work with and I I like to think of a studio as a as a teaching hospital.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s a lot of.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s hands on, you can see out of my hands are sliced up and with my hands aren&rsquo;t cut up in callus it means I&rsquo;m too busy polishing that plastic keyboard with my fingertips writing emails. But there is a virtue in making that still very alive.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And certainly among some of the number of the artists are in this room here. We and it might not be the biggest trend right now, but I can. I&rsquo;m only going to speak to what I do and what I think is important because I&rsquo;m not devoted to the work of others. Otherwise I&rsquo;d be working for them. Obviously very.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Devoted to what we do.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But um.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>You know, I I.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I have to admit, you know I&rsquo;m a huge fan which want that one of those. So anything that I say that&rsquo;s smart, 60% of that came from Tom just recycling it.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Turned out to be no, but.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Then all the dumb stuff&rsquo;s on the.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I did read we read the pin word, which is great an I still still still think very relevant even though of course.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Rose</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I I guess I I was taken with a couple of things one.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a passage about Picasso.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And in the painted world, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember this, but you did write it.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>We talk about.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe: So he he he figured out.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To get rich gracefully, yes.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And not have.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Holes in his sneakers, like I&rsquo;m rocking today.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>How he would show up at at the events and and custom made some real clothes and versus the young artist who shows up at the museum modern art gala wearing a paint splatter jeans an at the at the black tie event saying I&rsquo;m just a kid. Don&rsquo;t take me seriously quest. He managed to figure out how to.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Bohemian and bourgeois at the same time.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Is that fair?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And I, I think the main difference, I think, in the things that have changed since that was written now, is that there have been some words invented like Generation X or Generation Y and Millennials that have defined in a different understanding of what wealth and power means in art.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>In our society it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And even since radical chic, there&rsquo;s been a different perspective on sitting in radical chic. You say that the history of New York socialite is is as complex. The history of the political politics in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>You said.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>So I I, I think it&rsquo;s interesting how and what I loved about painting. Word wasn&rsquo;t so much all the art stuff because I don&rsquo;t like. I don&rsquo;t know. I hate art.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>No, and that&rsquo;s I make it because.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah and no one else is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Gonna do it right, so that&rsquo;s why I do it.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Exactly right, I mean there.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Are couple of people in this room that do.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>A pretty good job, no fans, but this constraint.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yes, there are going to be at when Rambo.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Was informed by.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A journalist that he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Considered the greatest hits, 32 years old. Considered the greatest artist in France.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>His response was mid pull up Boise.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Which I thought was and showed that he.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Just didn&rsquo;t care, right? He absolutely, absolutely didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, I think because will carry.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Now as my as I understand it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The Castle quit art school at 8:15, saying that there&rsquo;s nothing more like teaching. Unfortunately, the very next month and next semester. Rather, they were teaching anatomy and perspective.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And if I found myself in a hole like that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t finish something called Cubism.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I had no perspective and it really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Matter how you draw it again.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But he that started it then started bad.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Exactly 1900 to listen.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And some of the other artists, friends who like.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Right, for example, how?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t stand the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a cavalier attitude towards them.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To the extent right down the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The attitude of artist today is his.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty interesting to Maine.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think they Maurizio.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Heading one of his recent works is manicle. Many cans of ship.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we get.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Because this had been done before by.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Manzoni, yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It did something called a shitshow.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And this is part of taking art out of the studio or studio environment.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Pushing in a ways.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You never performance, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>See much of that equipment.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But performance art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>What is her name she?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Appears she doesn&rsquo;t appear negative anymore.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Maria yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why she quits now, I mean.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>By clicking when you made it to 60 this way.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of the way to just kind of the way it goes.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Will talk dentek. She keeps it going. It&rsquo;s authentic.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>One of her recent shows.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To get to the show, unless she&rsquo;s still going negative, this one. There were two naked people at the door.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A man and a woman. And you had to squeeze between you think there&rsquo;s no way you could walk again. You will squeeze between them to get just to see the top is lady inside.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I suppose azarova kind.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well can I can I ask you some questions?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Making sure not guaranteed to get ready.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>At some place.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Because there was an issue that to me is plaguing.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Me or it&rsquo;s my if the focus of not just the art that I make any other artists in this room mate, but it&rsquo;s almost the plague of consumerism. And it&rsquo;s this constant search for authenticity.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s Marina not being naked now that she&rsquo;s 70. If that is an expression of inauthenticity or fear, or</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Nothing, it&rsquo;s just more UN gracefully than a beautiful woman&rsquo;s ego or whatever.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>The the desire for authenticity is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Seems like the most valuable thing that we have this culture makers.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And whether that&rsquo;s authenticity of an experience as told by a writer or the authentic experience of Art, where does it come from? Why are these people making these things like? Why would you make?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>The performance piece you just described or what would you make a giant?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Bunny or whatever.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Pictures of you and your girlfriend made into glass.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>I mean, I think I.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>I think I know why I do it, but I&rsquo;m curious if you if you know if you&rsquo;ve been able to.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Through all of your.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Observations of not just art, but the world find a connection between the different kinds of authenticity that people seek and why they make stuff.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I think most people who become artists or writers.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I have no idea of making a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Living, I mean that just seems.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Somehow you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Which is kind of is.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is it&rsquo;s kind of nice.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always a danger if you made it with one particular picture or piece of music, or it may be.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That you get.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You get stuck in that because success. You don&rsquo;t want to let that success go.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He was born in human.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Spent the last 22 years of his life so trying to workout.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The problem is, if any of putting.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Stripes of color assigned.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>One another, I think it could have moved on he saw.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Who is so good at it?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>People liked it. I mean they are.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The art world, but why is it that I love the phrase The Art World?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The art world.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, I figured is made of made up of. I used to. I used to fit the figure of 10,000 people worldwide album maybe.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is a little more now, but of which about 3000, when the United States and 2700 of those with in our toasted New York.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably changed. This probably changed.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A little a little bit.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The idea that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The public is turning it back on great art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Laughable.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh laughable theory, because they don&rsquo;t see great art. They&rsquo;re sending memo after it&rsquo;s done saying This is.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>These are the Great.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Artist in this year.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they either just accept that or or they don&rsquo;t. But then the the 3000, let&rsquo;s say if that&rsquo;s a correct number in New York there.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Or the least of all groups.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The critics of Messenger boys today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They just get the word from the art world.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they bring it to the newspapers. When&rsquo;s the last time you saw a printing on a major newspaper or magazine? Go out on a limb saying This is like this guy is the greatest?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never seen anyone you when nobody else was agreeing. It doesn&rsquo;t happen anymore. It used to happen where there would be prediction made later point.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, going out ahead of the crowd, no, no longer.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s kind of that that that&rsquo;s kind of A.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A shame, but the art world is made up of Curators.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Collectors and Gallery owners.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Some artists so that there.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Are some artists who remember that after that world?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they make all of the decisions and the same thing is true in Italy. Same is true in France, England.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Anne.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it is not a world, it&rsquo;s a, It&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete, it&rsquo;s a community.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, I love things today though I notices.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Can we talk about the money in our?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There is a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Very wealthy collectors have a tremendous impact.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In art is a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Interesting if you think of it as a commodity. It&rsquo;s about the only one in which every.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Piece is unique.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, you can you know books you can sell?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>300,000 copies of.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The book and there&rsquo;s nobody.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Feels OK with them.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Epic Laidlaw said authenticity of the piece.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But in in artists and art, it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Is some says the?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>World&rsquo;s largest unregulated commodities market.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That is true. I mean, there are things you can do in the ways you get hyped. Certain people got high prices.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That would be literally against the law.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah, it happens. I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And any any other industry that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Was I think all our industry.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>When you get into esoteric things like furniture.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, and there&rsquo;s a furniture auction coming up.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The planning done by the major dealer &lsquo;cause, nobody, but the deals really knows what&rsquo;s going on in the furniture.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The planning on who&rsquo;s on things like who&rsquo;s going to win the auction.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yes, that would be allowed either. I mean not even be allowed, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, eventually I can see that that stuff changing, but for now it&rsquo;s still.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a little still, little Gray.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But to me, going back to the idea of the critics seemed a little heartbreaking. Is did. Did anyone know or study with Sidney tell &lsquo;em, do you know, Sidney?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It must not.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Anyway, said he said that a critic.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>He wrote for arts and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Other things, and he he wrote.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Critic is a man with ideas. I think that&rsquo;s what you were saying, that you barely see. An art art critic in a newspaper standing up and saying.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Anything one way or another about an artist usually.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>If anything will condemn it &lsquo;cause everyone thought.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>That once it loves to be a hater that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But to have an idea about starting to bring it to light is something that I think the artists need are the art community needs people with ideas because I, you know, I&rsquo;ve got ideas about my heart and I write about him, but ultimately they&rsquo;re just an excuse for my blue collar activities. I really like just putting up bathroom shelves. That&rsquo;s my.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Goal, that&rsquo;s where I was going. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m like, Mike fast even with tile I&rsquo;m not afraid of drilling into tile.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But community is very important and we need people with ideas and the critics that I run into very often use overly complex words like to shore up their on on complex ideas.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>God love relational aesthetics. That&rsquo;s not my favorite. One state I&rsquo;ve just been watching Hennessy youngman. Is anyone watch Tennessee younger OK? Does anyone worship at the temple in Tennessee?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Is great critic art critic and who is up his medium is on YouTube so you can go watch him talk about art on YouTube and his his bit about relational aesthetics. Relational aesthetics is basically.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Have a have a party invite all your friends in an art Gallery and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Caller relational aesthetics that state this issue takes a little.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Better than that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But that seems to be refined. Keeps it that simple.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>When I moved into the area of the Instagram.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And Twitter, yes.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>28,000 followers everybody.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be interesting.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there I am obsessed with it. I&rsquo;m embarrassed and mortified, that&rsquo;s my crack.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Recently just unfollowed everyone because I can&rsquo;t control myself, but every image that goes in there I obsess over. In fact, I just posted about 40 minutes ago saying with a picture of the sign that was out front saying This is happening now and the comments will be things like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>What the **** man? Why didn&rsquo;t you give me a little fair warning?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Stuff like that. &lsquo;cause what I&rsquo;m gonna get?</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>But it is community.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m reaching 28,000 people are scanning past that in a 10th of a second.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad 28,000.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>These are real followers. These aren&rsquo;t random like phony Asian like cyborgs. These are real people.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Marshall Mcluhan</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Sanism in the I&rsquo;ve got 1967.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In, in, in, in the future.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There will be no.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Really, no audience for newspapers and magazines said that by itself is a shrimp, and he said it&rsquo;s because the new generation of people born.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>50s I guess he said are.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They are the television has turned tribal Adonis. We could explain.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The steps here.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Television is turned in trouble and tribal people.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>If handed a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>With writing on it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Assume it&rsquo;s a trip.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Anything that somebody hasn&rsquo;t told it personally.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And that has come true.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Today</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Do you think of blogs?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A blog is that guy whispering in your ear.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And as you.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But people really do pay attention to compliance, even if the blog says something like.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Dawson</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember his first name, but that&rsquo;s OK in the block.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You can go on like that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less and less news is checked.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I mean, I knew I worked on newspapers here for 10 years and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Constantly checking out facts, constantly checking, calling your people to make.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Sure you got it right.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But if you, if you follow A blog or your.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your part of your tribe. You trap. You&rsquo;re trusting that person, even if their crazy and more on research.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s I. I agree with that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s less and less an actual noodles being being covered. I mean, I enjoy reading The Daily Beast there, or several those online services, but they they cherrypick they they see a juicy story. They run it, but they&rsquo;re not going around.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>English education beats 2.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Just to see what the the trends are. Only education Peter newspaper. He&rsquo;s lucky if you got two stories in the newspaper of week, but you&rsquo;re out there talking to attack, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t happen any longer.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who you trust.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t. I wanna say you know, Trust Beyoncé, but you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know why I haven&rsquo;t been listening to her recently.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it again.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>But this is there.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>Is there art that you love? So there is as much as I hate art?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And you know, I always think of what C Montgomery Burns says I.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the evil power plant owner of The Simpsons?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about art.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I know what I hate and I don&rsquo;t hate this that much.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And there are things that I loved out there or I should say that things I don&rsquo;t hate that much. Is there anything that you don&rsquo;t hate that much?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well my I try not to let this influence my opinions, but my favorite artist.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Worked for a magazine called simpler systems. Needed social satire and they had been influenced by the discovery of Japanese painting, which the discovery was late in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And so they were terrific.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You all.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Trained artists that were terrific at doing features, particularly faces on hands, but they would leave other spaces.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Blank or just a solid? A solid color.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And people like, Oh Laughable. Branson, one of the best Bruno Paul Rudolph Vilca.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I look at those magazines.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Scott is over.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In fact, I have some some bounding simply so this big.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t do it today. The satirical artists are not trained artists most of the time. You can see this in in. In political cartoons came really.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Do not know any anatomy.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scared.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m better would all be. I don&rsquo;t care what what side they&rsquo;re on. If they were just Masters with it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Of the craft.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s asking.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t I.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t do it now?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I but I, you know someone should. Drawing is is about confidence, right? It&rsquo;s just about having, I think I can draw better than anybody.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Else in this room, but.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But my way.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair enough.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And can&rsquo;t argue with that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Exactly, I think the greatest thing about drawing as a test whether you want to do drawings or not.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Indicate you have control that you can do exactly what you what you want, and then you can go.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Basic training I think. Then you go off and do anything you want.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Do anything.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Search for drawing.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Adam.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Today in many ways.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceptual art takes take center stage in the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In the 20th century.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There was a constant attempt to refine art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So Cubism becomes a reaction against.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Falls studio work.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You get all into all the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The isn&rsquo;t something.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The late teens and 19.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Vorticism band</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Solidly left, impressionism fine, but</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Until finally</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>We got the abstract expression of how many people remember that they could never sell those bags they could. They could praise him through the skies, but nobody would thought.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A friend of mine was one time train.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>With Jackson Pollock coming in from Connecticut. And he just happened to know Jackson public and public with going over some figures and it turned out that he was making out his income tax and his income for that particular year was $2200.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And this is at a time when.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He had had double tracked spreads in life magazines.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Calling him</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Jack</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The Dripper.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t get anymore publicity.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They were just not. It was just not something that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>People love pop art so much collectors did.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But pop artists could not do anything they wanted. I mean, they had. They had to do things that had already been done. You think of all the love comics?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Right, I can see that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Carpet, pretty pretty.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Faithfully, if you try to do something.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Creative you would be.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You would be left out of the loop.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But instead of.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I thought that was that was Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You done.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He do.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A piece about a car wreck into several words, but it&rsquo;s very important that they be painted. Photographs of actual car wrecks rather than something that came out of his.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Imagination then that was finally superseded by.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Things are the same tiny retire in their scope.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Such as.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>How you feel you finally get down to two things like.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Conceptual art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In which.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>People try to make it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Smaller and smaller and smaller to find you get.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The plastic piece I&rsquo;m trying to think.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I tried with the artist was in which he just had a list of instructions we said.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Solo it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I said you may view the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Picture or maybe view the work of water you don&rsquo;t, but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And or you can can view it and remember it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to even look at it. And this is this and this is just.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That was about as as tiny as his experience of argument could get other than just simply.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Not looking at, not writing.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I would argue that the conceptual artists, like the ones that when you&rsquo;re talking about, we&rsquo;re actually finding an authentic experience. Whereas like if you look at the.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Abstract, expected Rippers or the OR the Barnett newmans, obsessing about how colors and stripes were.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Next to each other.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Then I imagine the conceptual artists traveling to California.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Leaving New York which is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>The people in the art world that left Paris.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And you can.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>See, you know start from the Renaissance across Europe to Paris to New York and finally winding up at the edge of western civilization, California. That Malibu on the coast looking out the water. And like how the **** am I going to make art here? You&rsquo;ve got Hollywood, which is destroyed.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>So laws of reality, imaginary tales. You&rsquo;ve got the military and NASA destroying laws of physics, making rocket ships that go to the moon and kill God or stealth bombers or whatever. How am I going to make art? And so these guys I&rsquo;m thinking like John Baldessari.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Bruce, now more solid part.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>They are my favorite Douglas Hubler trying to create art. So what they do is they create a set of rules under which they&rsquo;re going to create art because they are. They&rsquo;re up against the existential abyss. There&rsquo;s nothing left and so.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>John baldassarri fans down on the ground he picks up.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>For tennis balls and he throws him up in the air and he quickly takes his camera and shoots a picture and and the piece is called 4 balls thrown in the air to make a perfect square. Best of 36 tries and it&rsquo;s good to on the film somebody you don&rsquo;t know this but filming step 36 exposure or so.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And then the other piece was 36 photos and that was the piece, and although it might sound kind of deadpan, and like nothing&rsquo;s really happening there, it was this attempt at finding meaning, and through these really simple gestures, of course, excellent presentation skills.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>All these guys.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>They were able to find something that communicated about their experience.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And, well, I don&rsquo;t know what I like is doing when he builds a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Should we call it?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A piece of sculpture out of 1200 bicycles.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they are looking at different angles upon each other, so that finally.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The Tower of bicycles.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is 900 feet.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a nine Storey building.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the word that many bicycles or investing in China. I guess there are probably lots of &lsquo;em.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>This was done on a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A small scale by Gabriel Roscoe. No kindling.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Famous Alaska.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A sculptor, just four bicycles. It&rsquo;s much admired.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this there is a a definite trend which using things that are already made.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Museum in in, in, in, in. Different and in different ways and and there are people.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Could say that what the New York Academy does.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is it unthinkable?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That was done in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>1645</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, That&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I like the Academy so much it it&rsquo;s not afraid to be revolutionary service. It&rsquo;s a revolutionary approach.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>These days</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And in in, in a way, it&rsquo;s too bad that photography exists because in the past.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You could paint a portrait.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And a generation later, everybody is in fact, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sir Henry.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To handle the smallest detail &lsquo;cause nobody can check, yeah, check it out.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Now you can check out these things out.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You know the portraitists often have a saying.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little something wrong.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>About the mouth, yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And often there is, but it was in the past. Nobody had anybody had that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That problem, what the disappearance of gradual disappearance?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Newspapers are going to do that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So now I I don&rsquo;t. I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be with somebody.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, I have to agree it&rsquo;s the schools important because one of the things that the hardest to master about being an artist is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Taking time to really see things for what they are.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And the studio&rsquo;s Bible is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Lawrence Weschler&rsquo;s book. About Robert Irwin.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Seeing is forgetting the name of the thing that one sees.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And to really see something you forget what it&rsquo;s called, you just see it for what it is and there&rsquo;s nothing like drawing. It forces you to do that. If you don&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t draw without seeing it when you can can kind of campus becomes a doodle or scribble, but really, by seeing how light hits an object, there&rsquo;s no more.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Meditative Act and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the foundations for thinking about stuff and without thinking about things. It&rsquo;s not really art unless it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Some kind of?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Primal Scream are thing where it&rsquo;s just about you&rsquo;re in but.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s got great virtues, so with you.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, I learned well. I think I learn anatomy by.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Doing drawings of boxes in Ring magazine.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That was great. I mean, you really get a lot of angles, bodies and so forth. The one problem is their hands are covered these drugs.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So then I realized.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Then it became an obsession with me.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Learning to draw hands.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And now I I must confess, I judged mostly realistic work. First, like first, I go to the hands.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>What do you think of Leonardo?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember who is famous for being bad at drawing hands, right? That&rsquo;s one of those weird things. If it means like the artist, right?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, that was certainly true love.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Along with the Eric.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Rockstar points and of course Picasso well. Picasso had been so distorted even he did not draw. He didn&rsquo;t really have to draw hands.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But others, when they were in that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Early bound and Arthur is still doing figures.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It was ingenious.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Where they would hide the hands behind the back.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Because they just couldn&rsquo;t do them.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause you&rsquo;ve got five different planes. I gotta figure out that you&rsquo;re working with.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t be so narrow minded, just keep looking at hands like that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ultimate measure.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, tans is how how we think right without our hands where.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You know we&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Not human.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I need to be there, have been great books.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>About the how that in hand in the brain have to evolve together the opposable thumb.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s another whole Ave.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Evolutionary.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Science.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot about the relationship between hands and speech.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>As if you couldn&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t do speech without the hands, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s that fantastic, like the best worst written best book ever called a Craftsman by Richard Sennett.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re going to read that one.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I know who he is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Great premise and he goes extensively into conversation to thought about.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>The about the hand.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And how it&rsquo;s an extension of our mind?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, if you get into.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>If you find a civilization that made tools.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You can be sure.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But they could speak.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Give speeches.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Speech is the primal artifact.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And only when you have.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Speech can you make other artifacts whether.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an axle or.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>747 Air Airplane</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole universe.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But if it runs against.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The The Science of painting which is I keep being told. I don&rsquo;t really understand what it means, is that right brain activity.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Because I asked it well anyway.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>We build a 747 by.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Cooperating with each other, we can&rsquo;t. No man can build a 747 by themselves.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So they can build on actually lived up to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Honey again, having that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Right, it takes and so that speech, and that&rsquo;s how we dominate is through cooperation, right?</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Oh, Speaking of speech and hands, I wanted to see if anybody wanted to raise their hand and ask questions to be there. These two gentlemen in the remaining time that we have.</p>
<p>Speaker 3</p>
<p>This whole Rd. The first great piece about the excess is of art. Collecting in 1968 about the skulls.</p>
<p>Speaker 3</p>
<p>And I was wondering, when you split this that excess if you ever imagined that it could just keep going and keep going and keep going.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That book had absolutely no effect.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>O it did keep going.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And going and going.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Until.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Until you have things like no hands are. I mean when you consider that Jeff Curbs now has 120 people, that&rsquo;s the last figure I saw.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Working for him.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And then they do.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Drawings that he indicates after the conception of on a computer and then they use computers and so you have those drawings by Jeff Koons.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Who could say?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a huge. It&rsquo;s a. It&rsquo;s a huge operation. This is big and operational.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Biggest operation is in any of the greatest challenge of the Renaissance. Yeah, they had. They had some lots of lots of folks. Raphael had lots of folks.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That that beats all.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Who would have ever seen him coming?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>2030 years ago, when I wrote that book.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Like as both the tones are when you discuss.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The diminishment of people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>Speaker 3</p>
<p>End of newspapers of administrative newspapers.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I notebook I would send it totally unreadable and I love.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Him worst written best book is such a good idea, worse crafted.</p>
<p>Speaker 4</p>
<p>But the the Craftsman is about exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about about hands and having a sensitivity for materials, etc. So what I want to ask you is, given the diminishment of these skills or time to look at these things.</p>
<p>Speaker 4</p>
<p>What else do you think we&rsquo;re losing and is it lost, or is something else replacing it that you are excited enough? That is a good thing? Or is it all downhill from here?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well defined, one big problem, I think is that, Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I got the more common.</p>
<p>Tom WolfeAudio file</p>
<p>tomsachsandtomwolf.mp3</p>
<p>Transcript</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s an extremely dynamic tension. It&rsquo;s old versus new skill versus concept, tradition versus innovation. And tonight Tom versus Tom.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>We are lucky to have two creative geniuses with us that represent both ends of our spectrum. In this corner. Tom Wolfe, one of America&rsquo;s best known and best selling authors. He&rsquo;s credited with creating the new journalism movement along with the likes of Hunter Thompson and Gay Talese. He is also an artist.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>An an illustrator who is designed the covers of several of his own books like he has expressed his strong ideas about art and design through several books and essays, including the painted word an from our house to Bauhaus. In those books he&rsquo;s made the case that theory has become too important in art.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>And that the art world is too controlled by a small elitist network of critics, dealers, and collectors. By the way he&rsquo;s rumored to have a new book coming out in 2016. I was trying to meet with him for a couple of weeks over the summer and he kept delaying me because he was on deadline so.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>I think the deadlines finished by now.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Or is it still?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Got it, got some scrub me up to do.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>So OK, OK, but anyway. So we finally did. We finally did get together and had a great afternoon in this corner. Tom Sachs. Tom is an artist, primarily a sculpture.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Best known for his elaborate recreations of cultural icons and luxury brands through duct tape, phone books, foamcore and police barricades like Tom Wolfe Sachs idolizes astronauts, and that thing has continued through his space program, NASA and.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Mars projects. He&rsquo;s also written many things and produced many writings and and seems on his work usually also illustrated by him. He is interested in the traditional and the handmade and utilizes them in his work, and though the work may be beautiful, the underlying theme is always.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Conceptual, so whether it&rsquo;s Tom versus Tom or Tom and Tom or Tom loves Tom, we&rsquo;ll see how the thing goes tonight. I did want to also say thank you to Magnum real estate for hosting this event. We wanted you all to come here to see what our new student housing looks like.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>This, by the way, is.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>A double it&rsquo;s not a single.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>So just so you know.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>And the school itself is just around the corner on Franklin Street between West Broadway and church. And for anybody who has not been there, please come and visit us. We have over 100 Studios with a constantly changing.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Array of very exciting, wonderful, an mostly figurative but not totally mostly figurative work, and we hope to see you next week. It takes a minute on October 18th.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Oh my God.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Dog on the 18th. And by the way, it&rsquo;s at Sotheby&rsquo;s not at the school, so don&rsquo;t show up at the school. Tom Wolf will have a piece in it, and I, uh, I hope by the end of the night, time&rsquo;s actually agreed to have a piece in it as well. This all is just an elaborate.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Setup to get it to come in something so.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>But for tickets see the beautiful Allison Hillier over there or go to our website and wear white in honor of Tom Wolfe, who is one of the honorees along with the art critic Jerry Saltz, so without further ado, I give you Tom and Tom.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll take a shot at.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I did check 2 new.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Art forms today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>When I called, no hands are.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And the other is 10 year apart, as in T for Tom EE for easy and for Nathan.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You are in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Probably the best examples of.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>No hands are Jeff Koons and Richard Serra.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I was just looking at some pictures today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Jeff Koons and his woman, who was briefly married who called the Cuccinello, who gained fame through a scandal in Italy, was still famous when she came here.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they had some pictures taken polaroids. I believe of themselves in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I just about every position that nude bodies convenient.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And so you can imagine.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um, I couldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>These were sent off to some elves.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In the Midwest and we turned into 3 dimensional. The photographs he didn&rsquo;t touch the intensity photographs they were sent off to some else in the Midwest I think was Cleveland and they converted him into 3 dimensional glass sculptures.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Portugal.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So extraordinary something.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s no, I mean they.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how many.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Copies of each one there is, but there&rsquo;s no.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That is not necessary limit.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s also done 45 for high rabbits.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Other people did them made of dirt. Yeah, other people handling girls getting heated up this thing.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>These are a number of other.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Works.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Along that line.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Can your heart?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is something different?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A lot of it is conceptual art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And the idea is to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ll give you an example.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>This is one I saw near Lakeland FL.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The artist invited as many people as he could to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Media matters what was actually a like a small Lake.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Coming and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He had with him 8.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m really heavy chain. I barely heard that I&rsquo;ve ever seen aside from something on a ship.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Away delaughter either end of the chain he had a large polyurethane bag full of vegetables.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So he laid the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Chain on top of the water.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um, of course I could be related to the bottom, but use mostly come back. I think it was 2 two months or something. I think I went. I was curious. I heard back.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And now the chain was lying on with a stretch across the top of the water. The vegetables had rotted.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Alright, in the bag creating a gas.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That was enough to to lift it up. Now. I mean, I was astounded, but there&rsquo;s no way you could sell that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s where tenure art comes in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Also, the tenure artists are conceptual, and if you can do enough things like that enough works like that and get some publicity.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You have a pretty good shot at getting a job teaching on the faculty, and after six years it used to be 10 years after six years. Now you get tenure.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And you&rsquo;re not going to live this high, but you&rsquo;re not going to have to live hard.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You will be paid until your retirement age and then you get a pension.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>No more starving artist today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Those are I.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I have changed.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A lot since I wrote the painted.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Work Oh my gosh, when did that come out?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>About 19, about 1980. I guess seven 1976.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s true.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s exciting.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>No, I&rsquo;m not done. That would be great.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I love those artists and this year we lost Chris Burton, who is the kind of artists who might have done a piece like the chain and the and the gas and the routing vegetables and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>How I fit in with that? But I I would say that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Because I work with people and I do, I have.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Valves in the Midwest.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I also have a team of 10 people that I work with and I I like to think of a studio as a as a teaching hospital.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Where there&rsquo;s a lot of.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Everything&rsquo;s hands on, you can see out of my hands are sliced up and with my hands aren&rsquo;t cut up in callus it means I&rsquo;m too busy polishing that plastic keyboard with my fingertips writing emails. But there is a virtue in making that still very alive.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And certainly among some of the number of the artists are in this room here. We and it might not be the biggest trend right now, but I can. I&rsquo;m only going to speak to what I do and what I think is important because I&rsquo;m not devoted to the work of others. Otherwise I&rsquo;d be working for them. Obviously very.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Devoted to what we do.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But um.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>You know, I I.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I have to admit, you know I&rsquo;m a huge fan which want that one of those. So anything that I say that&rsquo;s smart, 60% of that came from Tom just recycling it.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Turned out to be no, but.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Then all the dumb stuff&rsquo;s on the.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I did read we read the pin word, which is great an I still still still think very relevant even though of course.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Rose</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I I guess I I was taken with a couple of things one.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a passage about Picasso.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And in the painted world, I don&rsquo;t know if you remember this, but you did write it.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>We talk about.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So he he he figured out.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To get rich gracefully, yes.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And not have.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Holes in his sneakers, like I&rsquo;m rocking today.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>How he would show up at at the events and and custom made some real clothes and versus the young artist who shows up at the museum modern art gala wearing a paint splatter jeans an at the at the black tie event saying I&rsquo;m just a kid. Don&rsquo;t take me seriously quest. He managed to figure out how to.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>B.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Bohemian and bourgeois at the same time.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Is that fair?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And I, I think the main difference, I think, in the things that have changed since that was written now, is that there have been some words invented like Generation X or Generation Y and Millennials that have defined in a different understanding of what wealth and power means in art.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>In our society it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And even since radical chic, there&rsquo;s been a different perspective on sitting in radical chic. You say that the history of New York socialite is is as complex. The history of the political politics in the Caribbean.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Like</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>You said.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>So I I, I think it&rsquo;s interesting how and what I loved about painting. Word wasn&rsquo;t so much all the art stuff because I don&rsquo;t like. I don&rsquo;t know. I hate art.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>No, and that&rsquo;s I make it because.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah and no one else is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Gonna do it right, so that&rsquo;s why I do it.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Exactly right, I mean there.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Are couple of people in this room that do.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>A pretty good job, no fans, but this constraint.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yes, there are going to be at when Rambo.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Was informed by.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A journalist that he wasn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Considered the greatest hits, 32 years old. Considered the greatest artist in France.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>His response was mid pull up Boise.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Which I thought was and showed that he.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Just didn&rsquo;t care, right? He absolutely, absolutely didn&rsquo;t care.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, I think because will carry.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Now as my as I understand it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The Castle quit art school at 8:15, saying that there&rsquo;s nothing more like teaching. Unfortunately, the very next month and next semester. Rather, they were teaching anatomy and perspective.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And if I found myself in a hole like that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t finish something called Cubism.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I had no perspective and it really doesn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Matter how you draw it again.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But he that started it then started bad.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Exactly 1900 to listen.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And some of the other artists, friends who like.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Right, for example, how?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Couldn&rsquo;t stand the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He&rsquo;s got a cavalier attitude towards them.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To the extent right down the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The attitude of artist today is his.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s pretty interesting to Maine.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to think they Maurizio.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Wow.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Heading one of his recent works is manicle. Many cans of ship.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s what we get.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Because this had been done before by.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Manzoni, yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It did something called a shitshow.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And this is part of taking art out of the studio or studio environment.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Pushing in a ways.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You never performance, I didn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>See much of that equipment.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But performance art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>What is her name she?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Appears she doesn&rsquo;t appear negative anymore.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Maria yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know why she quits now, I mean.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>By clicking when you made it to 60 this way.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But that&rsquo;s kind of the way to just kind of the way it goes.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Will talk dentek. She keeps it going. It&rsquo;s authentic.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>One of her recent shows.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To get to the show, unless she&rsquo;s still going negative, this one. There were two naked people at the door.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A man and a woman. And you had to squeeze between you think there&rsquo;s no way you could walk again. You will squeeze between them to get just to see the top is lady inside.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I suppose azarova kind.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well can I can I ask you some questions?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Making sure not guaranteed to get ready.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>At some place.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Because there was an issue that to me is plaguing.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Me or it&rsquo;s my if the focus of not just the art that I make any other artists in this room mate, but it&rsquo;s almost the plague of consumerism. And it&rsquo;s this constant search for authenticity.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And whether it&rsquo;s Marina not being naked now that she&rsquo;s 70. If that is an expression of inauthenticity or fear, or</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Nothing, it&rsquo;s just more UN gracefully than a beautiful woman&rsquo;s ego or whatever.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>The the desire for authenticity is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Seems like the most valuable thing that we have this culture makers.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And whether that&rsquo;s authenticity of an experience as told by a writer or the authentic experience of Art, where does it come from? Why are these people making these things like? Why would you make?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>The performance piece you just described or what would you make a giant?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Bunny or whatever.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Pictures of you and your girlfriend made into glass.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>I mean, I think I.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>I think I know why I do it, but I&rsquo;m curious if you if you know if you&rsquo;ve been able to.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Through all of your.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Observations of not just art, but the world find a connection between the different kinds of authenticity that people seek and why they make stuff.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I think most people who become artists or writers.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I have no idea of making a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Living, I mean that just seems.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Somehow you&rsquo;ll do it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Which is kind of is.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is it&rsquo;s kind of nice.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s always a danger if you made it with one particular picture or piece of music, or it may be.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That you get.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You get stuck in that because success. You don&rsquo;t want to let that success go.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He was born in human.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Spent the last 22 years of his life so trying to workout.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The problem is, if any of putting.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Stripes of color assigned.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>One another, I think it could have moved on he saw.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Who is so good at it?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>People liked it. I mean they are.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The art world, but why is it that I love the phrase The Art World?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The art world.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, I figured is made of made up of. I used to. I used to fit the figure of 10,000 people worldwide album maybe.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is a little more now, but of which about 3000, when the United States and 2700 of those with in our toasted New York.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s probably changed. This probably changed.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A little a little bit.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The idea that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The public is turning it back on great art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Laughable.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh laughable theory, because they don&rsquo;t see great art. They&rsquo;re sending memo after it&rsquo;s done saying This is.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>These are the Great.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Artist in this year.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they either just accept that or or they don&rsquo;t. But then the the 3000, let&rsquo;s say if that&rsquo;s a correct number in New York there.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Or the least of all groups.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The critics of Messenger boys today.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They just get the word from the art world.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they bring it to the newspapers. When&rsquo;s the last time you saw a printing on a major newspaper or magazine? Go out on a limb saying This is like this guy is the greatest?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve never seen anyone you when nobody else was agreeing. It doesn&rsquo;t happen anymore. It used to happen where there would be prediction made later point.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, going out ahead of the crowd, no, no longer.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s I think there&rsquo;s kind of that that that&rsquo;s kind of A.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A shame, but the art world is made up of Curators.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Collectors and Gallery owners.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Some artists so that there.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Are some artists who remember that after that world?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they make all of the decisions and the same thing is true in Italy. Same is true in France, England.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Anne.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s it is not a world, it&rsquo;s a, It&rsquo;s a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a complete, it&rsquo;s a community.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, I love things today though I notices.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Can we talk about the money in our?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There is a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Very wealthy collectors have a tremendous impact.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In art is a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Interesting if you think of it as a commodity. It&rsquo;s about the only one in which every.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Piece is unique.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, you can you know books you can sell?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>300,000 copies of.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The book and there&rsquo;s nobody.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Feels OK with them.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Epic Laidlaw said authenticity of the piece.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But in in artists and art, it&rsquo;s a different story.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Is some says the?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>World&rsquo;s largest unregulated commodities market.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That is true. I mean, there are things you can do in the ways you get hyped. Certain people got high prices.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That would be literally against the law.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah, it happens. I&rsquo;ve seen it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And any any other industry that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Was I think all our industry.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>When you get into esoteric things like furniture.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, and there&rsquo;s a furniture auction coming up.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The planning done by the major dealer &lsquo;cause, nobody, but the deals really knows what&rsquo;s going on in the furniture.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The planning on who&rsquo;s on things like who&rsquo;s going to win the auction.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yes, that would be allowed either. I mean not even be allowed, you&rsquo;re right.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, eventually I can see that that stuff changing, but for now it&rsquo;s still.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s still a little still, little Gray.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But to me, going back to the idea of the critics seemed a little heartbreaking. Is did. Did anyone know or study with Sidney tell &lsquo;em, do you know, Sidney?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It must not.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Anyway, said he said that a critic.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>He wrote for arts and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Other things, and he he wrote.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Critic is a man with ideas. I think that&rsquo;s what you were saying, that you barely see. An art art critic in a newspaper standing up and saying.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Anything one way or another about an artist usually.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>If anything will condemn it &lsquo;cause everyone thought.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>That once it loves to be a hater that&rsquo;s easy.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But to have an idea about starting to bring it to light is something that I think the artists need are the art community needs people with ideas because I, you know, I&rsquo;ve got ideas about my heart and I write about him, but ultimately they&rsquo;re just an excuse for my blue collar activities. I really like just putting up bathroom shelves. That&rsquo;s my.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Goal, that&rsquo;s where I was going. That&rsquo;s where I&rsquo;m like, Mike fast even with tile I&rsquo;m not afraid of drilling into tile.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But community is very important and we need people with ideas and the critics that I run into very often use overly complex words like to shore up their on on complex ideas.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>God love relational aesthetics. That&rsquo;s not my favorite. One state I&rsquo;ve just been watching Hennessy youngman. Is anyone watch Tennessee younger OK? Does anyone worship at the temple in Tennessee?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Is great critic art critic and who is up his medium is on YouTube so you can go watch him talk about art on YouTube and his his bit about relational aesthetics. Relational aesthetics is basically.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Have a have a party invite all your friends in an art Gallery and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Caller relational aesthetics that state this issue takes a little.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Better than that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But that seems to be refined. Keeps it that simple.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Or what&rsquo;s going to happen?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>When I moved into the area of the Instagram.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And Twitter, yes.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>28,000 followers everybody.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s gonna be interesting.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s there I am obsessed with it. I&rsquo;m embarrassed and mortified, that&rsquo;s my crack.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Recently just unfollowed everyone because I can&rsquo;t control myself, but every image that goes in there I obsess over. In fact, I just posted about 40 minutes ago saying with a picture of the sign that was out front saying This is happening now and the comments will be things like.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>What the **** man? Why didn&rsquo;t you give me a little fair warning?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Stuff like that. &lsquo;cause what I&rsquo;m gonna get?</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>But it is community.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And I&rsquo;m reaching 28,000 people are scanning past that in a 10th of a second.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not bad 28,000.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>These are real followers. These aren&rsquo;t random like phony Asian like cyborgs. These are real people.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Marshall Mcluhan</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Sanism in the I&rsquo;ve got 1967.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>OK.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In, in, in, in the future.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There will be no.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Really, no audience for newspapers and magazines said that by itself is a shrimp, and he said it&rsquo;s because the new generation of people born.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>50s I guess he said are.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They are the television has turned tribal Adonis. We could explain.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The steps here.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Television is turned in trouble and tribal people.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>If handed a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>With writing on it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Assume it&rsquo;s a trip.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They won&rsquo;t believe.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Anything that somebody hasn&rsquo;t told it personally.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And that has come true.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Today</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Do you think of blogs?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A blog is that guy whispering in your ear.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And as you.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But people really do pay attention to compliance, even if the blog says something like.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Dawson</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t remember his first name, but that&rsquo;s OK in the block.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You can go on like that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s less and less news is checked.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I mean, I knew I worked on newspapers here for 10 years and.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Constantly checking out facts, constantly checking, calling your people to make.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Sure you got it right.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But if you, if you follow A blog or your.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s your part of your tribe. You trap. You&rsquo;re trusting that person, even if their crazy and more on research.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah, well, it&rsquo;s I. I agree with that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s less and less an actual noodles being being covered. I mean, I enjoy reading The Daily Beast there, or several those online services, but they they cherrypick they they see a juicy story. They run it, but they&rsquo;re not going around.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>English education beats 2.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Just to see what the the trends are. Only education Peter newspaper. He&rsquo;s lucky if you got two stories in the newspaper of week, but you&rsquo;re out there talking to attack, that&rsquo;s it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It just doesn&rsquo;t happen any longer.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know who you trust.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t. I wanna say you know, Trust Beyoncé, but you can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, I don&rsquo;t know why I haven&rsquo;t been listening to her recently.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it again.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>But this is there.</p>
<p>Speaker 2</p>
<p>Is there art that you love? So there is as much as I hate art?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And you know, I always think of what C Montgomery Burns says I.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Who&rsquo;s the evil power plant owner of The Simpsons?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know about art.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I know what I hate and I don&rsquo;t hate this that much.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And there are things that I loved out there or I should say that things I don&rsquo;t hate that much. Is there anything that you don&rsquo;t hate that much?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well my I try not to let this influence my opinions, but my favorite artist.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Worked for a magazine called simpler systems. Needed social satire and they had been influenced by the discovery of Japanese painting, which the discovery was late in the 19th century.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And so they were terrific.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You all.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Trained artists that were terrific at doing features, particularly faces on hands, but they would leave other spaces.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Blank or just a solid? A solid color.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And people like, Oh Laughable. Branson, one of the best Bruno Paul Rudolph Vilca.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I look at those magazines.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Scott is over.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In fact, I have some some bounding simply so this big.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And you don&rsquo;t do it today. The satirical artists are not trained artists most of the time. You can see this in in. In political cartoons came really.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Do not know any anatomy.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a scared.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m better would all be. I don&rsquo;t care what what side they&rsquo;re on. If they were just Masters with it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Of the craft.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But maybe that&rsquo;s asking.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Yeah, I don&rsquo;t I.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Didn&rsquo;t I didn&rsquo;t do it now?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But I but I, you know someone should. Drawing is is about confidence, right? It&rsquo;s just about having, I think I can draw better than anybody.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Else in this room, but.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But my way.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fair enough.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And can&rsquo;t argue with that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Exactly, I think the greatest thing about drawing as a test whether you want to do drawings or not.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Indicate you have control that you can do exactly what you what you want, and then you can go.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s almost like a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Basic training I think. Then you go off and do anything you want.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Do anything.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Search for drawing.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Adam.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Today in many ways.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s conceptual art takes take center stage in the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In the 20th century.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There was a constant attempt to refine art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So Cubism becomes a reaction against.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Falls studio work.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You get all into all the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The isn&rsquo;t something.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The late teens and 19.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Vorticism band</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Solidly left, impressionism fine, but</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Until finally</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>We got the abstract expression of how many people remember that they could never sell those bags they could. They could praise him through the skies, but nobody would thought.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A friend of mine was one time train.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>With Jackson Pollock coming in from Connecticut. And he just happened to know Jackson public and public with going over some figures and it turned out that he was making out his income tax and his income for that particular year was $2200.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And this is at a time when.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He had had double tracked spreads in life magazines.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Calling him</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Jack</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The Dripper.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You couldn&rsquo;t get anymore publicity.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>They were just not. It was just not something that&rsquo;s why.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>People love pop art so much collectors did.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But pop artists could not do anything they wanted. I mean, they had. They had to do things that had already been done. You think of all the love comics?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Right, I can see that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Carpet, pretty pretty.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Faithfully, if you try to do something.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Creative you would be.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You would be left out of the loop.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But instead of.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I thought that was that was Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You done.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>He do.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A piece about a car wreck into several words, but it&rsquo;s very important that they be painted. Photographs of actual car wrecks rather than something that came out of his.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Imagination then that was finally superseded by.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Things are the same tiny retire in their scope.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Such as.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>How you feel you finally get down to two things like.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Conceptual art.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In which.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>People try to make it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Smaller and smaller and smaller to find you get.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The plastic piece I&rsquo;m trying to think.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I tried with the artist was in which he just had a list of instructions we said.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Solo it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It was great.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I said you may view the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Picture or maybe view the work of water you don&rsquo;t, but you don&rsquo;t have to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And or you can can view it and remember it.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Oh, you don&rsquo;t have to even look at it. And this is this and this is just.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That was about as as tiny as his experience of argument could get other than just simply.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Not looking at, not writing.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I would argue that the conceptual artists, like the ones that when you&rsquo;re talking about, we&rsquo;re actually finding an authentic experience. Whereas like if you look at the.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Abstract, expected Rippers or the OR the Barnett newmans, obsessing about how colors and stripes were.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Next to each other.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Then I imagine the conceptual artists traveling to California.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Leaving New York which is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>The people in the art world that left Paris.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And you can.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>See, you know start from the Renaissance across Europe to Paris to New York and finally winding up at the edge of western civilization, California. That Malibu on the coast looking out the water. And like how the **** am I going to make art here? You&rsquo;ve got Hollywood, which is destroyed.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>So laws of reality, imaginary tales. You&rsquo;ve got the military and NASA destroying laws of physics, making rocket ships that go to the moon and kill God or stealth bombers or whatever. How am I going to make art? And so these guys I&rsquo;m thinking like John Baldessari.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Bruce, now more solid part.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>They are my favorite Douglas Hubler trying to create art. So what they do is they create a set of rules under which they&rsquo;re going to create art because they are. They&rsquo;re up against the existential abyss. There&rsquo;s nothing left and so.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>John baldassarri fans down on the ground he picks up.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>For tennis balls and he throws him up in the air and he quickly takes his camera and shoots a picture and and the piece is called 4 balls thrown in the air to make a perfect square. Best of 36 tries and it&rsquo;s good to on the film somebody you don&rsquo;t know this but filming step 36 exposure or so.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And then the other piece was 36 photos and that was the piece, and although it might sound kind of deadpan, and like nothing&rsquo;s really happening there, it was this attempt at finding meaning, and through these really simple gestures, of course, excellent presentation skills.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>All these guys.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>They were able to find something that communicated about their experience.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And, well, I don&rsquo;t know what I like is doing when he builds a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Should we call it?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A piece of sculpture out of 1200 bicycles.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And they are looking at different angles upon each other, so that finally.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The Tower of bicycles.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is 900 feet.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s like a nine Storey building.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know the word that many bicycles or investing in China. I guess there are probably lots of &lsquo;em.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>This was done on a.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A small scale by Gabriel Roscoe. No kindling.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Famous Alaska.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And he did.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>A sculptor, just four bicycles. It&rsquo;s much admired.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this there is a a definite trend which using things that are already made.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Museum in in, in, in, in. Different and in different ways and and there are people.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Could say that what the New York Academy does.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Is it unthinkable?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That was done in.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>1645</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a, That&rsquo;s one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I like the Academy so much it it&rsquo;s not afraid to be revolutionary service. It&rsquo;s a revolutionary approach.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>These days</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And in in, in a way, it&rsquo;s too bad that photography exists because in the past.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You could paint a portrait.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And a generation later, everybody is in fact, that&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s Sir Henry.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To handle the smallest detail &lsquo;cause nobody can check, yeah, check it out.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Now you can check out these things out.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You know the portraitists often have a saying.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a little something wrong.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>About the mouth, yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And often there is, but it was in the past. Nobody had anybody had that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That problem, what the disappearance of gradual disappearance?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Newspapers are going to do that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So now I I don&rsquo;t. I really don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t be with somebody.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, I have to agree it&rsquo;s the schools important because one of the things that the hardest to master about being an artist is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Taking time to really see things for what they are.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And the studio&rsquo;s Bible is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Lawrence Weschler&rsquo;s book. About Robert Irwin.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Seeing is forgetting the name of the thing that one sees.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And to really see something you forget what it&rsquo;s called, you just see it for what it is and there&rsquo;s nothing like drawing. It forces you to do that. If you don&rsquo;t, you can&rsquo;t draw without seeing it when you can can kind of campus becomes a doodle or scribble, but really, by seeing how light hits an object, there&rsquo;s no more.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Meditative Act and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s one of the foundations for thinking about stuff and without thinking about things. It&rsquo;s not really art unless it&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Some kind of?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Primal Scream are thing where it&rsquo;s just about you&rsquo;re in but.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And I think that&rsquo;s got great virtues, so with you.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, I learned well. I think I learn anatomy by.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Doing drawings of boxes in Ring magazine.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That was great. I mean, you really get a lot of angles, bodies and so forth. The one problem is their hands are covered these drugs.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So then I realized.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Then it became an obsession with me.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Learning to draw hands.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And now I I must confess, I judged mostly realistic work. First, like first, I go to the hands.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>What do you think of Leonardo?</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m trying to remember who is famous for being bad at drawing hands, right? That&rsquo;s one of those weird things. If it means like the artist, right?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, that was certainly true love.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Along with the Eric.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Rockstar points and of course Picasso well. Picasso had been so distorted even he did not draw. He didn&rsquo;t really have to draw hands.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But others, when they were in that.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Early bound and Arthur is still doing figures.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It was ingenious.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Where they would hide the hands behind the back.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Because they just couldn&rsquo;t do them.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>&lsquo;cause you&rsquo;ve got five different planes. I gotta figure out that you&rsquo;re working with.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Maybe I shouldn&rsquo;t be so narrow minded, just keep looking at hands like that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s the ultimate measure.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, tans is how how we think right without our hands where.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You know we&rsquo;re.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Not human.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I need to be there, have been great books.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>About the how that in hand in the brain have to evolve together the opposable thumb.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Oh, there&rsquo;s another whole Ave.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>In</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Evolutionary.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Science.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a lot about the relationship between hands and speech.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>As if you couldn&rsquo;t can&rsquo;t do speech without the hands, I don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true or not.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Well, there&rsquo;s that fantastic, like the best worst written best book ever called a Craftsman by Richard Sennett.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know if you&rsquo;re going to read that one.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I know who he is.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Great premise and he goes extensively into conversation to thought about.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>The about the hand.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And how it&rsquo;s an extension of our mind?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well, if you get into.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>If you find a civilization that made tools.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You can be sure.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But they could speak.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Give speeches.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Speech is the primal artifact.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And only when you have.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Speech can you make other artifacts whether.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an axle or.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>747 Air Airplane</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a whole universe.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But if it runs against.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The The Science of painting which is I keep being told. I don&rsquo;t really understand what it means, is that right brain activity.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Because I asked it well anyway.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>We build a 747 by.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Cooperating with each other, we can&rsquo;t. No man can build a 747 by themselves.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>So they can build on actually lived up to.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Honey again, having that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Right, it takes and so that speech, and that&rsquo;s how we dominate is through cooperation, right?</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Oh, Speaking of speech and hands, I wanted to see if anybody wanted to raise their hand and ask questions to be there. These two gentlemen in the remaining time that we have.</p>
<p>Speaker 3</p>
<p>This whole Rd. The first great piece about the excess is of art. Collecting in 1968 about the skulls.</p>
<p>Speaker 3</p>
<p>And I was wondering, when you split this that excess if you ever imagined that it could just keep going and keep going and keep going.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That book had absolutely no effect.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>O it did keep going.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And going and going.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Until.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Until you have things like no hands are. I mean when you consider that Jeff Curbs now has 120 people, that&rsquo;s the last figure I saw.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Working for him.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And then they do.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Drawings that he indicates after the conception of on a computer and then they use computers and so you have those drawings by Jeff Koons.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Who could say?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s a huge. It&rsquo;s a. It&rsquo;s a huge operation. This is big and operational.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Biggest operation is in any of the greatest challenge of the Renaissance. Yeah, they had. They had some lots of lots of folks. Raphael had lots of folks.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>But</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>That that beats all.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Who would have ever seen him coming?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>2030 years ago, when I wrote that book.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Like as both the tones are when you discuss.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The diminishment of people&rsquo;s hearts.</p>
<p>Speaker 3</p>
<p>End of newspapers of administrative newspapers.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I notebook I would send it totally unreadable and I love.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Him worst written best book is such a good idea, worse crafted.</p>
<p>Speaker 4</p>
<p>But the the Craftsman is about exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about about hands and having a sensitivity for materials, etc. So what I want to ask you is, given the diminishment of these skills or time to look at these things.</p>
<p>Speaker 4</p>
<p>What else do you think we&rsquo;re losing and is it lost, or is something else replacing it that you are excited enough? That is a good thing? Or is it all downhill from here?</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well defined, one big problem, I think is that, Oh yeah.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>I got the more common.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>One big.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Problem is.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well it is, I call.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Digital knitting</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s where all these things are that the digital telephones, Instagram, Twitter, Twitter.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Anne.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Number of others I had I really know.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Understand how to use it gives people away to knitting used to be a woman&rsquo;s occupation.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>To kill time would but at.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>The end, at least you had a pair of socks.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Houma killing time today you don&rsquo;t get anything.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And the information is probably bad too.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>This is a strange thing, well.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>I see it another way and that&rsquo;s the sure all the best artists are in Silicon Valley. They were wasting their time making sculptures like paintings and stuff. They&rsquo;re making iPhones and.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Inventing things like Uber that change the way we get around, but the other side is that all of this information is opened up a world of possibilities and it&rsquo;s this incredible research tool and and maybe it&rsquo;s in a way a reaction against some of this of the ******** of.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Twitter and the emptiness that all that. And that&rsquo;s where it really is. Empty the putty. I call it. Oh wait, I&rsquo;m going to elevate it for 45 seconds. I can be doing something with this time.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Checking Instagram or whatever.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>But what we found is that there&rsquo;s all this information, and that&rsquo;s why we have this incredible.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Pardon the expression.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Artisanal movement we&rsquo;ve got people making their own knives and butchering their own animals and and knitting. If you want to get a facehugger from alien on it into a sweater and a reverse hoodie that you can pull over your face, you can find someone who will.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Knit you that.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>In Pepsi</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And see it&rsquo;s like eBay, but it&rsquo;s really.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>For craft and it&rsquo;s a lot of it, most of it&rsquo;s crap, but you can find some great. You can find a woman in Iowa who&rsquo;s who&rsquo;s retired who will make you whatever you want and you can build a relationship with her and she can.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Make that because she&rsquo;s been knitting her whole life.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And you have access to that. Now. If you&rsquo;re willing to dig a little bit so.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>And artists have always been Sala, Terry, people, even someone like Andy Warhol, who is a huge celebrity even in this time ultimately of time by yourself. You know when you&rsquo;re writing or drawing, it&rsquo;s by yourself. And I don&rsquo;t. I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s changed, it&rsquo;s just a different.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Way of negotiating the world. A more superficial, quick, ******** way. But the information is there, you might have to, you know, the websites only take you so far. It might eventually you have to buy a book which is just like a computer.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>Keep turning the screens over and over again.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>You mentioned the quarrel, I think back. In fact, if he appeared he was, he understood. So if he appeared on a talk show, he would never talk, he twisted the.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Answer into the ear.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Affordable associate he brought.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Wrong with him.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>And there are some people like Andy world who cannot improve in other peoples estimation by talking talk show.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Um, like Elvis Presley never went on.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Attachment can only decrease his his his standing.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Now everyone is including me is sort of happy about being on talk show.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Kill your reputation real fast.</p>
<p>Tom Sachs</p>
<p>No, rehearsal just is 1 one go.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Other questions.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>Well, I think that wraps it up and I want to say thank you to everybody and especially thank you to.</p>
<p>MC</p>
<p>These two times.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>One big.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Problem is.</p>
<p>Tom Wolfe</p>
<p>Well it is, I call.</p>
